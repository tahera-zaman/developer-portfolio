            <h1>Early Life</h1>
            <h2>'What do you want to do when you're older?'</h2>
            <p>Beckham was born at Whipps Cross University Hospital in Leytonstone, London, England. He is the son of
                Sandra Georgina (née West; b. 1949), a hairdresser, and David Edward Alan "Ted" Beckham (b. Edmonton,
                London, 1948), a kitchen fitter, who married in the London Borough of Hackney in 1969. He has an older
                sister, Lynne Georgina, and a younger sister, Joanne Louise. He attended Chingford County High School in
                Ridgeway Park, Chingford. In a 2007 interview, Beckham said that, "At school whenever the teachers
                asked, 'What do you want to do when you're older?' I'd say, 'I want to be a footballer.' And they'd say,
                'No, what do you really want to do, for a job?' But that was the only thing I ever wanted to do."
                Beckham's maternal grandfather was Jewish, and Beckham has referred to himself as "half Jewish" and
                wrote in his autobiography "I've probably had more contact with Judaism than with any other religion".
                In his book Both Feet on the Ground, Beckham stated that growing up he attended church every week with
                his parents, because that was the only way he could play football for their team.</p>

                <h2>Manchester United</h2>
                <h3 class="orange-color">1991-1994: Youth and early career</h3>
                <p>Having signed for Manchester United as a trainee on 8 July 1991, Beckham was part of a group of young
                    players, including Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes, who were
                    coached
                    by Eric Harrison, and helped the club win the FA Youth Cup in May 1992. Beckham scored Manchester
                    United's second goal in the 30th minute of their 3-1 first-leg win of the final against Crystal
                    Palace
                    on 14 April 1992. In the second leg on 15 May, Beckham played a full 90-minutes of the fixture which
                    ended 3-2 in favour of Manchester United and 6-3 on aggregate. Beckham's impact led to a first-team
                    debut on 23 September 1992, as a substitute for Andrei Kanchelskis in a League Cup match against
                    Brighton & Hove Albion. Shortly afterwards, Beckham signed as a professional on 23 January 1993.
                    Manchester United again reached the final of the FA Youth Cup, where they faced Leeds United. The
                    first
                    leg was played on 10 May 1993, where Beckham started in Manchester United's 2-0 home loss but was
                    replaced by substitute Robbie Savage. In the second leg on 13 May 1993, Beckham played the full 90
                    minutes of Manchester United's 2-1 defeat, which gave Leeds United a 4-1 aggregate score.</p>

                <h2>Real Madrid</h2>
                <h3 class="orange-color">2003-2004: Becoming a Galáctico</h3>
                <p>As the summer 2003 transfer window approached, Manchester United appeared keen to sell Beckham to
                    Barcelona and the two clubs even announced that they reached a deal for Beckham's transfer, but
                    instead
                    he joined reigning Spanish champions Real Madrid for €37 million on a four-year contract. Beckham
                    was
                    the latest signing in the Galácticos era of global stars signed by club president Florentino Pérez
                    every
                    summer. The news came as a bitter blow to the newly elected Barcelona president Joan Laporta, who
                    based
                    much of his presidential campaign on signing Beckham. Though announced in mid-June, the transfer was
                    completed on 1 July 2003, making him the third Englishman to play for the club, after Laurie
                    Cunningham
                    and Steve McManaman. Following a successful medical on 2 July, Beckham was unveiled in front of 500
                    accredited journalists from 25 countries at Real's basketball facility, where he was handed the
                    famous
                    white shirt by club legend Alfredo Di Stéfano.</p>
