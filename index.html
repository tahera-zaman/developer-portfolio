            <h1>Early Life</h1>
            <h2>'What do you want to do when you're older?'</h2>
            <p>Beckham was born at Whipps Cross University Hospital in Leytonstone, London, England. He is the son of
                Sandra Georgina (n√©e West; b. 1949), a hairdresser, and David Edward Alan "Ted" Beckham (b. Edmonton,
                London, 1948), a kitchen fitter, who married in the London Borough of Hackney in 1969. He has an older
                sister, Lynne Georgina, and a younger sister, Joanne Louise. He attended Chingford County High School in
                Ridgeway Park, Chingford. In a 2007 interview, Beckham said that, "At school whenever the teachers
                asked, 'What do you want to do when you're older?' I'd say, 'I want to be a footballer.' And they'd say,
                'No, what do you really want to do, for a job?' But that was the only thing I ever wanted to do."
                Beckham's maternal grandfather was Jewish, and Beckham has referred to himself as "half Jewish" and
                wrote in his autobiography "I've probably had more contact with Judaism than with any other religion".
                In his book Both Feet on the Ground, Beckham stated that growing up he attended church every week with
                his parents, because that was the only way he could play football for their team.</p>
